[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findreferee_pkg.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "referee_pkg", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "referee_pkg" with
  any of the following names:

    referee_pkgConfig.cmake
    referee_pkg-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "referee_pkg" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "referee_pkg_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "referee_pkg" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
